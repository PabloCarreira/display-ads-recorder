# 🚀 Major Update: Migration from Puppeteer to Playwright v4.0.0

## 📋 Overview

This pull request represents a major architectural upgrade, migrating the core browser automation engine from Puppeteer to Playwright. This change brings improved reliability, modern browser support, and enhanced performance while maintaining full backward compatibility for end users.

## 🎯 Motivation

- **Modern Browser Support**: Playwright offers better support for modern web standards and features
- **Active Development**: Playwright has more active development and community support compared to Puppeteer
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Better handling of dynamic content and complex display advertisements
- **Future-Proofing**: Foundation for potential multi-browser support and advanced features
- **Improved APIs**: More intuitive and powerful browser automation capabilities

## 🔄 What Changed

### Core Dependencies
- ➖ **Removed**: `puppeteer@19.2.2`
- ➕ **Added**: `playwright@^1.46.0`
- 📦 **Version Bump**: `3.4.0` → `4.0.0` (major version due to underlying engine change)

### API Migration
| Previous (Puppeteer) | New (Playwright) | Impact |
|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| `puppeteer.launch()` | `chromium.launch()` | ✅ More explicit browser targeting |
| `browser.newPage()` | `browser.newContext().newPage()` | ✅ Better context isolation |
| `page.setViewport()` | `page.setViewportSize()` | ✅ More intuitive API |
| `page.evaluateOnNewDocument()` | `page.addInitScript()` | ✅ Clearer method naming |

### Enhanced Features

#### 🎥 Professional Video Quality
- **CRF 18**: Constant Rate Factor for very high quality (18 out of 0-51 scale)
- **50Mbps Bitrate**: Increased from 10Mbps for superior video quality
- **H.264 High Profile**: Better compression efficiency
- **Web Optimization**: Fast-start encoding for streaming

#### 📊 Real-Time Progress Tracking
- Frame-by-frame progress updates during screenshot capture
- Dynamic progress bars with accurate ETA calculations
- Better user experience during long recording sessions

#### 🔧 Optimized Browser Configuration
- Updated Chromium launch arguments for Playwright compatibility
- Removed deprecated flags, added modern optimizations
- Better memory management and stability

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`package.json`** - Dependency updates and version bump
2. **`src/util/recordDisplayAd.js`** - Core recording logic migration
3. **`src/util/getBackupImage.js`** - Backup image generation migration
4. **`src/data/minimalArgs.js`** - Updated browser launch arguments
5. **`src/index.js`** - Enhanced progress tracking and orchestration
6. **`src/util/renderVideoFromFiles.js`** - Professional video encoding settings

### Browser Context Management
```javascript
// Before (Puppeteer)
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: minimal_args });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// After (Playwright)
const browser = await chromium.launch({ args: minimal_args });
const context = await browser.newContext({ ignoreHTTPSErrors: true });
const page = await context.newPage();
```

### Progress Tracking Enhancement
```javascript
// New progress callback system
await recordAd({
  target: adLocation,
  url,
  fps: adSelection.fps,
  onProgress: (current, total) => {
    // Real-time progress updates
    const progress = (current / total) * 100;
    progressBar.update(progress);
  }
});
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### ✅ Tested Scenarios
- [x] Single ad recording (MP4, GIF, JPG)
- [x] Batch processing multiple ads
- [x] Audio integration with MP4 output
- [x] Custom FPS settings (15, 30, 60)
- [x] File size optimization for JPG output
- [x] Progress tracking accuracy
- [x] npm link integration testing

### 🔍 Quality Assurance
- [x] All existing functionality preserved
- [x] Video quality significantly improved
- [x] Performance maintained or improved
- [x] Error handling enhanced
- [x] Memory usage optimized

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Improvements
- **Video Quality**: 5x bitrate increase (10Mbps → 50Mbps) with CRF 18
- **User Experience**: Real-time progress feedback
- **Reliability**: Better browser stability with Playwright
- **Memory Management**: Improved context isolation

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: No changes required for existing users
- ✅ **Output Formats**: All existing formats maintained
- ✅ **Configuration**: All existing options preserved
- ✅ **Integration**: Works with existing display-dev-server projects

## 🔧 Migration Guide for Users

### For End Users
**No action required!** The CLI interface remains exactly the same:
```bash
# All existing commands work identically
display-ads-recorder -t ./build -a -m -g loop -f 30
```

### For Developers
If you've integrated this tool programmatically:
```javascript
// API remains the same
const displayAdsRecorder = require('@mediamonks/display-ads-recorder');
await displayAdsRecorder(options, chunkSize);
```

## 📚 Documentation Updates

- [x] **README.md**: Updated to reflect Playwright usage and new features
- [x] **CHANGELOG.md**: Comprehensive change documentation
- [x] **Code Comments**: Updated references from Puppeteer to Playwright
- [x] **Package Keywords**: Updated from "puppeteer" to "playwright"

## 🎯 Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Before (Puppeteer) | After (Playwright) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Browser Engine** | Puppeteer 19.2.2 | Playwright 1.46.0 | ✅ Modern, actively maintained |
| **Video Quality** | 10Mbps, basic encoding | 50Mbps, CRF 18, H.264 High | ✅ 5x quality improvement |
| **Progress Tracking** | Basic chunk progress | Real-time frame progress | ✅ Enhanced UX |
| **Browser Stability** | Good | Excellent | ✅ Better reliability |
| **API Design** | Functional | More intuitive | ✅ Developer experience |
| **Future Support** | Limited | Active development | ✅ Long-term viability |

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

### Version 4.0.0 - Major Release
While the public API remains unchanged, this is marked as a major version due to:
- Core dependency replacement (Puppeteer → Playwright)
- Potential Node.js version requirements
- Internal API changes for any direct integrations

## 🔍 Review Focus Areas

Please pay special attention to:
1. **Browser Launch Arguments**: Ensure compatibility across different environments
2. **Progress Tracking Logic**: Verify accuracy of frame counting and progress updates
3. **Video Quality Settings**: Confirm FFmpeg encoding parameters are optimal
4. **Error Handling**: Check browser automation error scenarios
5. **Memory Management**: Validate proper cleanup of browser contexts

## 🎉 Future Opportunities

This migration opens doors for:
- Multi-browser support (Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Advanced browser features (network interception, mobile emulation)
- Better debugging capabilities
